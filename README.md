## Introduction to PLL
- PLL stands for phase locked loop.
- It is a control system that tracks the output frequency and synchronises it with the reference signal.
- It is used to get a precise clock signal without frequency or phase noise.

### PLL Components
- Phase frequency detector-> it is used to compare output signal with reference signal.
- charge pump -> it converts the digital comparision into anolog signal.
- Low pass filter -> it is used to smoothen the charge pump output signal.
- voltage controlled oscillator-> it is the onchip oscillator.
- frequency divider ->it is used to convert the whole system into frequency multiplier.
